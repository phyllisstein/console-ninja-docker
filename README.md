# Console Ninja/Docker Compose
This app reproduces, in part, the issue raised in [#2](https://github.com/wallabyjs/console-ninja/issues/2).

## Reproduction case
Starting from a bare Create React App repo, I've ejected the app to ensure it's running Webpack and created [a Docker Compose file](./docker-compose.yml) that mounts the app in a standard Node 16 container. The setup is as na√Øve as possible: I've avoided customization to prevent introducing bugs unrelated to Console Ninja. From there, I added `console.log` statements to [`App.js`](src/App.js) and [`index.js`](src/index.js). I made no other code changes.

As expected, running `yarn start` from a Visual Studio Code terminal connects Console Ninja.

The problem arises from the absolute paths in the Webpack instrumentation:

```js
/* build-hook-start *//*00001*/try { require('/Users/daniel/.vscode/extensions/wallabyjs.console-ninja-0.0.54/out/buildHook/index.js').default({tool: 'webpack'}); } catch(e) { try { import('file:///Users/daniel/.vscode/extensions/wallabyjs.console-ninja-0.0.54/out/buildHook/index.js').then(m => m.default.default({tool: 'webpack'})).catch(p => {}) } catch(e) { }}/* build-hook-end */
```

`docker-compose.yml` creates a bind mount for the entire repo, _including_ `node_modules`. If I run `docker compose up` and `docker compose exec app head node_modules/webpack/lib/index.js`, I can see the same snippet installed inside the container. But `/Users/daniel/.vscode` only exists on my host machine. If I add `console.error` to those `catch` statements, I can see that the `require` call still throws the original poster's error:

```
yarn run v1.22.19
$ node scripts/start.js
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/Users/daniel/.vscode/extensions/wallabyjs.console-ninja-0.0.54/out/buildHook/index.js' imported from /app/node_modules/webpack/lib/index.js

}
```

Mounting packages inside the Docker container is not a best practice, but it's tough to avoid.


## Paths to resolution
A working Docker integration would require at least two changes: a containerized script and a stable port.

The code at `$HOME/.vscode/extensions` needs to run inside _the container_ without explicit references to paths and modules on _the_ host_. Developers generally configure Docker to mount a single repo, so you'd have to inject the integration script at a known path under `$PWD`. `node_modules` is an obvious candidate.

I'm gleaning from the trace logs that the VSCode extension communicates with the instrumentation script over an automatically assigned port. But a port number must be explicitly exposed on the container for the host machine to see it. In the Compose file, `ports` can specify a `target`, the port inside the container to which an app binds, and a `published` port, which Docker connects to the container's `target`.

```yaml
ports:
  # Connect an app running on port 3000 inside Docker to the same port on the
  # host.
  - target: 3000
    published: 3000
    protocol: tcp
    mode: host
  # Connect the same app, bound to port 3000 inside the container, to port 3333 on
  # the host.
  - target: 3000
    published: 3333
    protocol: tcp
    mode: host
  # Connect the port 3000 inside the container to a random ephemeral port on the
  # host.
  - target: 3000
    protocol: tcp
    mode: host
```

I don't have any clever suggestions for this one: syncing an agreed-upon port between Docker, VSCode, the extension script, and the developer sounds like a nightmare.
